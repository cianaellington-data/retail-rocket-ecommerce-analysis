# Retail Rocket E-commerce Capstone

This capstone analyzes 2.7M+ e-commerce events from the Retail Rocket platform using R and the tidyverse.

## Overview
The project explores user behavior, conversion trends, and top-performing products to identify opportunities for revenue growth and customer retention.

## Key Analyses
- Conversion Funnel: View → Add to Cart → Transaction
- Purchases by Hour of Day
- Top 10 Categories by Purchases
- Top 10 Items by Purchases
- Customer Loyalty Insights

## Files
- `Retail_Rocket_Capstone.ipynb` — Full Kaggle notebook with code and charts
- `Retail_Rocket_Capstone.html` — Rendered version for easy viewing
- `clean_events.csv` — Cleaned events dataset (subset of Kaggle dataset)
- `clean_purchase_items.csv` — Cleaned purchase items dataset

## Key Findings
- Only 2.6% of users who view products add them to the cart; 0.84% complete a purchase.
- Purchases peak between 6–8 PM — optimal marketing window.
- Top 10 product categories contribute ~30% of revenue.
- Certain items have high purchases per customer — strong indicators of loyalty.

## Tools & Libraries
- **R** (tidyverse, dplyr, ggplot2, readr)
- **Kaggle** for data exploration and notebook development
